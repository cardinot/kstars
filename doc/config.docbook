There is a list of over 3400 predefined cities available to choose from.
You set your location by highlighting a city from this list.  Each
city is represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city
is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location
in the map.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary>
<secondary>Filtering</secondary></indexterm>
It is not practical to scroll through the full list of 3400 locations,
looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be
filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in
the screenshot, the text <quote>A</quote> appears in the
<guilabel>City Filter</guilabel> box, while <quote>Te</quote> has been
entered in the <guilabel>Province Filter</guilabel> box, and
<quote>USA</quote> is in the <guilabel>Country Filter</guilabel>
box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list have city,
province, and country names that begin with the entered filter
strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 6
cities are matched by the filters.  Also notice that the dots
representing these six cities in the map have been colored white,
while the unmatched cities remain gray.
</para><para>
The list can also be filtered by location in the map.  Clicking anywhere
in the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the
clicked location.  At this time, you can search by name, or by location,
but not both at once.  In other words, when you click on the map, the
name filters are ignored, and vice versa.

The <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude, latitude</link> and
<link linkend="ai-timezones">time zone</link> information for the
currently-selected location are displayed in the boxes at the bottom of
the window.  If you feel that any of these values are inaccurate, you
can modify them and press the <guibutton>+</guibutton> (Add City) button
to record your custom version of the location.  You can also define a
completely new location by pressing the
<guibutton>Clear Fields</guibutton> button, and entering the data for
the new location.  Note that all fields except the optional
<guilabel>State/Province</guilabel> must be filled before the new
location can be added to the list.  &kstars; will automatically load
your custom locations for all future sessions.  Please note, at this
point, the only way to remove a custom location is to remove the
appropriate line from the file
<filename>~/.kde/share/apps/kstars/mycities.dat</filename>.

<indexterm><primary>Date and Time</primary>
<secondary>The simulation clock</secondary></indexterm>
When &kstars; starts up, the time is set to your computer's system
clock, and the &kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time.
If you want to stop the clock, select <guimenuitem>Stop
Clock</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or simply
click on the <guiicon>Stop Clock</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  You can
make the clock run slower or faster than normal, or even make it run
backward, using the time-step spinbox in the toolbar.  This spinbox
has two sets of up/down buttons.  The first one will step through all
83 available time steps, one by one.  The second one will skip to the
next higher (or lower) unit of time, which allows you to make large
timestep changes more quickly.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Date and Time</primary>
<secondary>Setting</secondary></indexterm>
You can set the  time and date by selecting <guimenuitem>Set
Time...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or by
pressing the <guiicon>time</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  The
<guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window uses a standard &kde; Date Picker
widget, coupled with a spinbox for setting the hours and minutes. 
If you want to re-synchronize the simulation clock back to the
current CPU time, just select <guimenuitem>Set Time to Now</guimenuitem>
from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu.</para>

<note><para>
<indexterm><primary>Date and Time</primary>
<secondary>Extended range of dates</secondary></indexterm>
&kstars; can accept very remote dates beyond the usual limits imposed by
QDate.  Currently, you can set the date between the years -100000 and +100000.
We may extend this range even further in future releases.  However, please
be aware that the accuracy of the simulation becomes more and more degraded
as more remote dates are examined.  This is especially true for the positions
of solar system bodies.

<title>The Configure &kstars; Window</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Configure &kstars;</guilabel> window allows you to modify
a wide range of display options.  You can access the window with the
<guiicon>configure</guiicon> toolbar icon, or by selecting
<guimenuitem>Configure &kstars;...</guimenuitem> from the

</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary>
<secondary>Catalogs page</secondary></indexterm>
In the <guilabel>Catalogs</guilabel> page, you determine which object
catalogs are displayed in the map.  The <guilabel>Stars</guilabel> section
also allows you to set the
<quote>faint <link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitude</link> limit</quote>
for stars, and the <link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitude</link> limit for
displaying the names and/or magnitudes of stars.  Below the stars section,
the <guilabel>Deep-Sky Objects</guilabel> section controls the display of
several non-stellar object catalogs.  By default, the list includes the
Messier, NGC and IC catalogs.  You can add your own custom object catalogs
by pressing the <guibutton>Import Catalog...</guibutton> or <guilabel>Load Catalog...</guilabel> button.  For
detailed instructions on preparing a catalog data file, see the
<filename>README.customize</filename> file that ships with &kstars;. It is possible to define
faint limits for sky objects for zoomed in and zoomed out states of the rendering. When
the <guilabel>Show objects of unknown magnitude</guilabel> item is enabled, objects whose
magnitudes are unknown, or not available to &kstars;, are drawn irrespective of the faint limits set.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary>
<secondary>Solar System page</secondary></indexterm>
In the <guilabel>Solar System</guilabel> page, you can specify whether
the Sun, Moon, planets, comets and asteroids are displayed, and
whether the major bodies are drawn as colored circles or actual images.
You can also toggle whether solar system bodies have name labels attached,
and control how many of the comets and asteroids get name labels.
There is an option to automatically attach a temporary <quote>orbit
trail</quote> whenever a solar system body is tracked, and another to
toggle whether the color of the orbit trail fades into the background
sky color.
</para>

<!-- Satellites page: -->
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary>
<secondary>Satellites page</secondary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Satellites</guilabel> page allows you to set the satellites view options. Firsly, 
you can see or hide the satellites on the skymap using <guilabel>Show satellites checkbox</guilabel> 
from the top <guilabel>View options</guilabel> section. By default, satellites are drawn as small 
light red filled circles with an optional dark red name label next to them. You can enable or disable 
these labels by checking or not the <guilabel>Show labels</guilabel> checkbox. It is located bellow 
the <guilabel>Show satellites</guilabel> checkbox, within the <guilabel>View options</guilabel> section. 
The colors of the dots representing satellites and their name labels can be easily customized using 
the <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> page from the same <guilabel>Configure KStars</guilabel> window. 
In addition, satellites can be drawn just like regular stars by checking the <guilabel>Draw satellites 
like stars</guilabel> checkbox. To display only the visible satellites from your current geographic location 
and time, select <guilabel>Show only visible satellites</guilabel>.
KStars can draw artificial satellites from many predefined groups. Thus, you can select to display a particular 
group, multiple groups or partially select subgroups. Under each group, a list of individual satellites is 
presented. To select all satellites from a group, you need to check the group checkbox. You can also select 
only the satellites of interest in each group.
The satellites orbital elements can be updated via the internet by pressing the <guibutton>Update TLEs</guibutton> 
button. Another way for updating the satellites orbital elements is to click on <guilabel>Data -> Updates -> Update 
satellites orbital elements</guilabel> option. If you know the name of a desired satellite then you can use 
the search satellites method that KStars provides. You need to enter the name of satellite in the <guilabel>Search 
satellites</guilabel> text box and the list will be reduced only to its best matches.
You can add new satellites to KStars default satellites set by editing the "kstars/data/satellites.dat" file.
As each line of this file is a group of satellites, you need to add a new entry for your desired satellites group. 
An entry should have the following format: "Group Name;local_filename;url". 
For example: "Iridium;iridium.tle;http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/iridium.txt".
</para>
<!-- Supernovae page: -->
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary>
<secondary>Supernovae page</secondary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Supernovae</guilabel> page allows you to decide if the supernovae are displayed or not by checking 
the <guilabel>Show supernovae</guilabel> checkbox. By default, supernovae are drawn as small light orange '+' mark. 
As for satellites, the color of supernovae can be easily customized using the <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> page. 
You can configure KStars to check for newly discovered supernovae on startup by checking the <guilabel>Check for 
Recent Supernovae on Startup</guilabel> checkbox. This way, KStars will be always up-to-date with the most recent 
supernovae. You can enable supernova alerts using the <guilabel>Enable Supernova alerts</guilabel> checkbox. Thus, 
KStars will automatically alert you every time it learns of a new supernova in the sky. You can set the magnitude 
limit for showing a supernova as well as magnitude limit for supernova alerts using the spin boxes control. The 
limiting magnitude is the faintest apparent magnitude of an skyobject that is visible with the naked-eye or a telescope. 
The list of recent supernovae can be updated via the internet by pressing the <guibutton>Update List of Recent 
Supernovae</guibutton> button. Another way for updating the supernovae list is to click on 
<guilabel>Data -> Updates -> Update Recent Supernovae data</guilabel> option.

<indexterm><primary>Configure &kstars; window</primary>
<secondary>Guides page</secondary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Guides</guilabel> page lets you toggle whether non-objects
are displayed (&ie;, constellation lines, constellation names, the
Milky Way contour, the <link linkend="ai-cequator">celestial
equator</link>, <link linkend="ai-ecliptic">the ecliptic</link>, <link
linkend="ai-horizon">the horizon line</link>, and the opaque ground).
You can also choose whether you would like to see Latin constellation

<secondary>Colors page</secondary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Color Schemes</primary>
<secondary>Customizing</secondary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> page allows you to set the color scheme,
and to define custom color schemes.  The tab is split into two panels:
</para>
<para>
The left panel shows a list of all display items with adjustable
colors.  Click on any item to bring up a color selection window to
adjust its color.  Below the list is the <guilabel>Star Color
Mode</guilabel> selection box.  By default, &kstars; draws stars with
a <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic color</link> tint according
to the spectral type of the star.  However, you may also choose to draw
the stars as solid white, black or red circles.  If you are using the
realistic star colors, you can set the saturation level of the star
colors with the <guilabel>Star Color Intensity</guilabel> spinbox.
</para>
<para>
The right panel lists the defined color schemes.  There are four
predefined schemes: the <guilabel>Default Colors</guilabel> scheme,
<guilabel>Star Chart</guilabel>, which uses black stars on a white
background, <guilabel>Night Vision</guilabel>, which uses only shades
of red in order to protect dark-adapted vision, and <guilabel>Moonless
Night</guilabel>, a more realistic, dark theme.  Additionally,
you can save the current color settings as a custom scheme by clicking
the <guibutton>Save Current Colors...</guibutton> button.  It will prompt
you for a name for the new scheme, and then your scheme will appear in
the list in all future &kstars; sessions.  To remove a custom scheme,
simply highlight it in the list, and press the <guibutton>Remove Color
Scheme</guibutton> button.

</para><para>
<indexterm><primary>Atmospheric Refraction</primary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Correct for atmospheric refraction</guilabel> checkbox
controls whether the positions of objects are corrected for the effects
of the atmosphere.  Because the atmosphere is a spherical shell, light from
outer space is <quote>bent</quote> as it passes through the atmosphere to
our telescopes or eyes on the Earth's surface.  The effect is largest for
objects near the horizon, and actually changes the predicted rise or set
times of objects by a few minutes.  In fact, when you <quote>see</quote> a
sunset, the Sun's actual position is already well below the horizon;
atmospheric refraction makes it seem as if the Sun is still in the sky.
Note that atmospheric refraction is never applied if you are using
<guilabel>Equatorial coordinates</guilabel>.
</para><para>
<indexterm><primary>Animated Slewing</primary></indexterm>
The <guilabel>Use animated slewing</guilabel> checkbox controls how the
display changes when a new focus position is selected in the map.  By
default, you will see the sky drift or <quote>slew</quote> to the new
position; if you uncheck this option, then the display will instead
<quote>snap</quote> immediately to the new focus position.
</para><para>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary>
<secondary>Labeling</secondary>
<tertiary>Automatic</tertiary>
</indexterm>
If the <guilabel>Attach label to centered object</guilabel> checkbox is
selected, then a name label will automatically be attached to an object
when it is being tracked by the program.  The label will be removed when
the object is no longer being tracked.  Note that you can also manually
attach a persistent name label to any object with its <link
linkend="popup-menu">popup menu</link>.
</para><para>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary>
<secondary>Hiding</secondary></indexterm>
There are three situations when &kstars; must redraw the sky display very
rapidly: when a new focus position is selected (and <guilabel>Use
animated slewing</guilabel> is checked), when the sky is dragged with the
mouse, and when the time step is large.  In these situations, the positions
of all objects must be recomputed as rapidly as possible, which can put
a large load on the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev>.  If the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev>
cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish or jerky.
To mitigate this, &kstars; will hide certain objects during these rapid-redraw
situations, as long as the <guilabel>Hide objects while moving</guilabel>
checkbox is selected.  The timestep threshold above which objects will be
hidden is determined by the <guilabel>Also hide if time step larger
than:</guilabel> timestep-spinbox.  You can specify the objects that should
be hidden in the <guilabel>Configure Hidden Objects</guilabel> group box.

what the view through a particular telescope would look like.  For example, if you choose
the <quote>7x35 Binoculars</quote> FOV symbol, then a circle is drawn on the display that is
9.2 degrees in diameter; this is the field-of-view for 7x35 binoculars.
